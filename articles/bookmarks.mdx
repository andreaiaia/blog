I stumbled upon a very interesting [blog post](https://www.marginalia.nu/log/19-website-discoverability-crisis/) by Viktor on his blog Marginalia. The post talked about the small web discoverability crisis.
In the last few decades we saw the web agglomerate into a few big platforms, and the small web, the web of personal websites, slowly disappear.
Search engines intoxicated tons of blogs with the SEO and the small blogs almost never appear in the first few pages of web result.
To make it easier to find the small web, Viktor created a list of websites he found interesting, a bookmarks page, and proposed to other bloggers to do the same. 


Below you can find my list of bookmarks, I hope you find something interesting.

## Articles 

Here's a selection of articles I liked.

The first one is an intriguing story about the not-so-well known career of Sir Isaac Newton outside of the scientific world: [Don’t mess with a genius](https://shreevatsa.wordpress.com/2010/06/04/dont-mess-with-a-genius/).

The second article is a reflection on all those people or companies that made a fortune and claims they tell you the secret of their success (think about the many posts on reddit or the ted talks with famous people saying you can do it too): [The Carrot Problem](https://www.atvbt.com/the-carrot-problem/).

The last link is not really an article, but I think it belongs here: it's a 3D reconstruction of the capital of the Aztech Empire, Tenochtitlan, now replaced by Mexico City. The 3D renders are accompanied by description of the places and bits of history of the Aztech civilization. At the end of the page there is also a comparison with modern day Mexico City. It is definitely worth a look: [A 3D Reconstruction of Tenochtitlan](https://tenochtitlan.thomaskole.nl/index.html).
