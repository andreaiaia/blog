In the carnivalesque Materan tradition, when a gentleman from a wealthy family killed a pig, the musicians of the city would go to his house asking to be offered some food and wine. In exchange, they would play for the master and mistress of the house from evening until morning. For this reason, the tradition is called "matinata".

The matinata has few but precise rules: the musicians present themselves at the master's house asking to be welcomed by weaving the praises of the master; if he refuses to welcome the musicians, the song changes and the musicians mock the master of the house.

After this tradition was almost lost, today the matinatas have been revisited in a modern key by various cultural associations and folk groups present in the territory.  

In contrast to the past, today a matinata is no longer organized on the occasion of a pig killing, since there are now very few breeders, but a matinata is organized with the complicity of one or more members of the family of the master or mistress of the house. Also, rarely does a modern matinata really last until the next morning, as modern rhythms no longer allow it.

Without further digressions, I leave you with the text of the typical matinata song, along with a photographic account of the matinatas I experienced this year.

## La Matenete

## La Matinata

Tok, tok, tok  
Hey Giovanni!  
Oh, who is it?  

When I show you faith without fail  
not thinking of you is forgotten affection  
  
Praise, singer, with fine sounds,  
with good intention I have begun,  
with the help of God we have arrived,  
we greet all of you whom we have found  
  
Godfather Giovanni, my master,  
I remain at Your Lordship’s grace,  
it is the Folk Group “Matera” that pays you homage,  
good evening from me and from the whole company  
  
Play, play, oh my instrument,  
touch the strings and let me hear you again,  
the guitar is better, not the violin,  
I wish to praise Biagino  
  
Of Biagino I cannot forget,  
his name is beautiful, I have learned it well,  
you carry the palm of spring,  
when you walk out from within Matera  
  
I was a prisoner and I returned,  
I was a prisoner in Germany,  
at the coming, alas, of the Poles,  
I found the girls with children in their arms  
  
I have a very flourishing garden,  
all the fruits I have planted,  
I also planted a square of cabbages,  
I wish to praise Onofriuccio  
  
Of Onofriuccio I cannot forget,  
his name is beautiful, I have learned it well,  
all the good I wish you,  
that you must die by tomorrow morning  
  
I have tamed flocks of horses,  
and you, girl, you do not want to be tamed,  
but if I manage to put the bit on you (of the bridle),  
without spurs I will make you submit  
  
Godmother Maria, my mistress,  
I remain at Your Lordship’s grace,  
please rise from the stool,  
go fetch the wine and put it in the mug  
  
Godfather Giovanni, my master,  
run to the door, come open it for me,  
run to the door, come open it for me,  
I bid you good night, for we are leaving.
